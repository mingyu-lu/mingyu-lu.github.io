## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

Hi!I am a Clinical Data Scientist at Philips Research North America. Prior to joining Philips, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [Laboratory for Computational Physiology](https://lcp.mit.edu/) at MIT and completed a MD degree at Kaohsiung Medical School and a Master of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medcial School. During my time in medical school, I also cofounded [TheTinyNote](https://www.thetinynotes.com), a website of physician-authored clinical decision support resources, allowing medical professionals to follow the more than 1500+ latest guidelines of diseases and clinical inquiry.
