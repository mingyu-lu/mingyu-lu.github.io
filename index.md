## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

Hi! I am a 1st year CSE phd student at University of Wahsington, advised by Su-In Lee at [Artificial Intelligence for Biological and Medical Sciences (AIMS)](https://aims.cs.washington.edu/). Prior to UW, I was a senior clinical data scientist at Philips Research North America (PRNA), specializing in developing clinical decision support systems with machine learning. I completed an MD degree at Kaohsiung Medical University and a Master of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School, and did 1-year postdoctoral research at [Laboratory for Computational Physiology](https://lcp.mit.edu/) at MIT. During my time in medical school, I cofounded [TheTinyNote](https://www.thetinynotes.com), a website of physician-authored clinical decision support resources, allowing medical professionals to follow the more than 1500+ latest guidelines of diseases and clinical inquiry.

## Research Interest

My research mainly focuses on Machine learning for Healthcare, ML4H. More specifically, I studies sequencial decision making (reinforcement learning) and counterfactual prediction (g-methods).
