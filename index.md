## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

Hi! I am a 4th year CSE Ph.D. student at the University of Washington, advised by Su-In Lee at [Artificial Intelligence for Biological and Medical Sciences (AIMS)](https://aims.cs.washington.edu/). My current research mainly focuses on interpretable machine learning (feature attribution, data attribution), generative models, sequential decision-making (reinforcement learning), and counterfactual prediction (g-methods), and their applications in the biomedical domain. 

You can reach out to me at mingyulu[at]cs[dot]washington[dot]edu
